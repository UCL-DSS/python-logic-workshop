# PY03 - Introduction to Python Programming - Logic

In this workshop we start to introduce conditional statements, logical statements **(if, else and elif)** and loops (**while** and **for**) and functions. 

These act as the foundations for developing more complicated and advanced workflows that you often see in Data Science and Sofware Development applications.
