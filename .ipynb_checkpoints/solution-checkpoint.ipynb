The result should be $2.0$. Now add a conditional statement inside your loop so the sum only includes even power terms in the series ie multiplied $1$ by $0.5$ an even number of times or when $i$ is even.

    "(OPTIONAL) Writing ````break```` within a loop will kill the loop. The summation we are looking at eventually converges meaning that subsequent terms are so small that the change to the summation total is not noticable. However, if we have set a the sum to run to a value of $i$ after convergence the code will still effectively wasting time. Use a conditional statement to determine when a new term is below some threshold value called the tolerance so that convergence can be determined. When this is the case simply write ````break```` to kill the loop. Then test your updated loop up to a value of $100000001$ which would normally take some time to run. If your code works the cell shouldn't take too much time to run since the loop breaks when the new values added to the sum become redundant. Use a tolerance value of $0.000000000000000000001$."
